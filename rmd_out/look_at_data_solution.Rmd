# Looking at the ecological dataset - Solution

Your code may look similar to this:

``` rsplus
# REcol Homework 1, Author: David Zeleny, Student ID: p12345678
load (url ('https://github.com/zdealveindy/anadat-r/raw/master/data/vltava.RData'))
max (vltava$env$pH) # maximum measured soil pH is 6.76
sum (vltava$spe[33,]) # sum of species cover is 173
mean (vltava$env$SOILDPT)  # mean soil depth is 23.71478 cm
sum (is.na (vltava$eiv$react)) # 104 species are generalists
sum (vltava$spe[64,]>0) # 44 species present in the plot 64
```

## Notes:
- do not include unnecessary code (e.g. `names (vltava)`, or `str (vltava)`);
- you can apply the function directly on the subsetted object, no need
  to create intermediate objects (i.e. you can do `max (vltava$env$pH)`,
  you don't need to do `q1 <- vltava$env$pH; max (q1)`); 
- when subsetting, single square brackets and double square brackets have different meaning; double square brackets (`[[`) are mainly used in `list` to subset its components.
