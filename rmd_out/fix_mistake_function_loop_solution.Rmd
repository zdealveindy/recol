# Fix my mistakes - sequentially.shortened.sequence function: Solution

*David Zeleny*
```rsplus
# Define the function:
sequentially.shortened.sentence <- function (sentence = 'No need to have R depression today,
things go perfectly smoothly!')
{
  for (i in nchar (sentence):1)
    print (substr (sentence, start = 1, stop = i))
}

# Run the function with default values:
sequentially.shortened.sentence ()

# Run the function with another sentence:
sequentially.shortened.sentence (sentence = 'Here we go! Go - where?')
```

## Additional notes to the solution:

- I could have also enclosed the expression `print` in the curly
  brackets (see code below), but since the `print` expression is only a
  single line of code, this is not necessary:

```rsplus
sequentially.shortened.sentence <- function (sentence = 'No need to have R depression today,
things go perfectly smoothly!')
{
  for (i in nchar (sentence):1)
    {
      print (substr (sentence, start = 1, stop = i))
    }
}
```
- As mentioned in the assignment, I wanted you to only fix my mistakes
  and mistypes, but not to rewrite the code; if you did, you probably
  got some minus points.
