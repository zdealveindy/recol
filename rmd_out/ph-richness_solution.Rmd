# Importing the data from vltava.txt file into R
vltava.env <- read.delim (file = 'c:\\Users\\Zeleny\\Dropbox\\REcol2017\\vltava.txt')

# Draw the figure into JPG file
jpeg (filename = 'c:\\Users\\Zeleny\\Dropbox\\REcol2017\\HW2_plot_z1234567.jpg')
plot (SPEC.NO ~ pH, data = vltava.env, xlab = 'Soil pH', ylab = 'Species richness')
dev.off ()
```
