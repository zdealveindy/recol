## Short introductory materials

    *[[http://www.cookbook-r.com/|Cookbook for R]] - website by Winston Chang, with handy advices how to do thinks from data management, simple analysis to plotting graphs. If you google some question "how to do something in R", you often land in this website.
    *[[http://www.statmethods.net/index.html|Quick R - accessing the power of R]]  (Rob Kabacoff) - relatively new website, focused on the R beginners (generally usefull, although it focuses on previous users of SPSS and SAS)
    *[[http://www.luchsinger-mathematics.ch/Bashir.pdf|Getting started in R]] (S.A. Bashir) - short English introduction
    *[[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf|R for beginners]] (Emmanuel Paradis) - longer English introduction
    *[[http://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~kulich/vyuka/Rdoc/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf|Simple R - using R for introductory statistics]] (John Verzani) - the most comprehensive English introduction
    * [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR|fasteR: Fast Lane to Learning R!]]  (Norm Matloff) - Learn R in non-tidyverse way!

## More advanced materials - still introduction, but focused on statistics

- ![Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and
  other
  beginners](/recol/materials/navaro_learning-statistics-with-r_0.6.pdf)
  (Danielle Navarro) (book website
  [here](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/))
- The new statistics with R: An introduction for biologist (Andy Hector)
  (NTU has [online version in
  library](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198729051.001.0001/acprof-9780198729051))

## Handouts - Short materials worth to be printed and kept handy

    *{{http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baggott-refcard-v2.pdf|R Reference Card v 2.0}} (Tom Short, Matt Baggott, Emmanuel Paradis) - simple handout with all important R commands and their explanation - keep it handy!
    *{{:recol:materials:ref_card_for_graphs.pdf|R Reference Card for graphs}} - plotting commands
    *{{:recol:materials:graphical-parameters.pdf|List of graphical parameters}} - from R Graphics (P. Murrell)
    * [[https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/|Cheat sheets for popular R packages]], e.g. [[https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf|stringr]] for work with strings, [[https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf|tidyr]] for reshaping data (e.g. wide-to-long format) and [[https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf|dplyr]] for manipulating (potentially huge) tables. All packages are from [[https://www.tidyverse.org/|tidyverse]].

  (Viktoria Wagner)
  - contains useful examples of working with strings (library `stringr`)
    and manipulating tables (`dplyr`).
