# Plot the effect of growth rate on a population following discrete logistic growth

*Po-Ju Ke*

## Introduction
In class, we have built a function that simulates the growth of a
population that follows discrete geometric growth. This is assuming that
resources are unlimited and therefore population growth does not slow
down as the population size continues to increase. If resources are
limited, the population will instead follow so-called "discrete logistic
growth", which can be written as:

$$
N_{t+1} = N_t\left[1 + r\left(1 - \frac{N_t}{K}\right)\right]
$$
where *r* is the species' intrinsic growth rate and *K* is the species'
carrying capacity (i.e., the maximum population size that the system can
sustain). You can see that if $N_{t} = K$,
$N_{t+1}$ will be equal to $N_{t}$ and the
population stops growing. While intuitively we would expect that the
population time series will approach the carrying capacity smoothly
(panel a in the figure below), in reality, the time lag associated with
discrete population growth may create many interesting dynamics. For
example, if the intrinsic growth rate is high, the population may
overshoot and reach the carrying capacity in a zig-zag motion (panel b).
Moreover, if the intrinsic growth rate is too high, the population
dynamics appear to jump randomly and never stabilizes (research has
shown that it will demonstrate chaotic dynamics). In this question, you
will re-create the figure below, which shows how the population time
series varies depending on the species' intrinsic growth rate.

## What to do

1.  Create a function `Logistic`. This function will take in four
    arguments: (1) initial population size $N_{0}$, (2)
    intrinsic growth rate, *r*, (3) carrying capacity, *K*, and (4)
    simulation time, *T*. The function will output a vector of size *T*,
    which begins at the initial population size and tells you the
    population size (following the discrete logistic growth equation
    above) at each time step.
2.  Run the function three times and save the output into three
    different objects. All three simulations have the same initial
    population size of 10, carrying capacity of 100, and are all run for
    40 time steps. The three simulations only differ in their intrinsic
    growth rate, with values equal to 0.6, 1.9, and 2.7, respectively.
3.  Plot the figure, consisting of three panels, each showing the
    population time series (i.e., population size on the y-axis and time
    on the x-axis) under different values of intrinsic growth rate.
4.  Make sure that you include the title of each plot (at the left upper
    corner of each panel), indicating the value of the intrinsic growth
    rate; also, the y-axis tick-mark labels are horizontal, and each
    panel has the same range of values on the y-axis (for this, you may
    need to find the maximum value of all simulated population time
    series). Also, include a dashed horizontal grey line passing through
    the carrying capacity (*K* = 100) to identify the expected
    population size if populations were to grow continuously.
5.  For the last panel, you will see that the population dynamics
    exhibit the so-called "chaotic motion". After time step 5, We are
    worried if the population size drops below 50 and wish to highlight
    those points when such low population size occurs. Please add
    another red horizontal line indicating this threshold (i.e., 50) and
    highlight points that are below this threshold.
6.  Save the figure into pdf file (height = 8 inches, width = 3 inches).
    The name of the file should be `DiscreteLogistic_XXXXXXXXXX.pdf`,
    where `XXXXXXXXXX` is your student ID.
7.  Make sure that the R code is tidy and fully reproducible!

The figure should look like this (note that this is a single figure with
three panels stacked together, not three figures):

## Hints

1.  the function should have similar structure to the one you practiced
    in class. However, please note that you should return a data.frame,
    not a vector. This can be done by first creating the vector as our
    previous practice, combining it with a vector of 1:T with the
    function `data.frame`, and then `return` it.
2.  to initiate the vector containing population sizes, you can use
    `rep` or `vector` and manually modify the first element.
3.  you will need the function `par` with argument `mfrow`.
4.  you will need the high-level function `plot` with arguments such as,
    but not limited to, `las` and `ylim`.
5.  for overlapping points and lines in `plot`, use type = `o`.
6.  the easiest way to create the last panel is to first plot the whole
    thing in black, then add the red points over the original black
    lines/points.
7.  highlight red points via subsetting and note that there are two
    criteria: time and population size.
8.  you might need the low-level function `abline` with the argument `h`
    (horizontal) set to a specific value.
9.  you might need the low-level function `title` with the argument
    `adj`.
