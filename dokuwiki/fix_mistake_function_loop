====== Fix my mistakes - sequentially.shortened.sequence function ======

//David Zeleny//

I wrote a bit silly R function ''sequentially.shortened.sequence'', which creates a sequentially shortened sentence, and prints it on screen. However, I was a bit in a hurry and did not really tidy up my R-code, so it may not work as expected. Would you please fix it up so that it works?

Note that I ask you to fix only the mistakes/mistypes, not to considerably rewrite and modify the script.

<code>
# define the function:
sequentially.shortened.sentence (sentence == "No need to have R depresssion today, things go
 perfectly smoothly!')
{
  for (i inn nchar (Sentence):1)
    print (substr (sentence, start = 1. stop = i))
}}

# Run the function with default values:
sequential1y.shortened,sentence {}

# Run the function with another sentence:
sequentiallly.sh0rtened.sentenCe (sentencece = 'Here we go! Go - where?'#)
</code>

When the code is correct, the first run of the function (with default values) will return this:

Hints:
  - Check the script first - is it really a definition of the function which should do all the job? And does it have too many or too few parentheses?
  - The function ''nchar'' counts the number of characters in the character string (e.g., ''nchar ("Hello Doly!")'' will return ''11''.
  - The function ''substr'' subsets the character string (e.g., ''substr ("Hello Doly!", start = 4, stop = 8)'' will return ''lo Do'').
