====== Redraw barplot from Excel to R ======

I created a nice barplot for my publication in Excel - see the snapshot of the Excel sheet below, it's really lovely:


[{{ :recol:figures:excel-snapshot-barplot.png?direct&750 |**Figure 1**. Print screen of the Excel file with the original barplot.}}]

However, when I want to submit my paper and I read the author's guidelines for manuscript preparation, I found that the journal (//Oecologia//) explicitly states (in guidelines for authors): //Do not use Excel (.xls) for figure.//

[{{ :recol:figures:oecologia-artwork-instructions.png?direct&750 |**Figure 2.** Snapshot of Author's guidelines for publication in the journal //Oecologia//. }}]

That sounds like not a good news. So I decided to redraw it in R, using the grey-scale colours to save money for colour printing:

[{{:recol:figures:word-snapshot-barplots_in_r.png?direct&750|**Figure 3.** Print screen of the Word document with the inserted barplot recreated in R.}}]

**What to do:** Please, create a perfectly reproducible and portable script (see below what I mean), which will draw the figure of barplots similar to the one included in a Word document in Fig. 3. The barplot should have the following requirements:
  * it should be one figure with 2 panels marked as (a) and (b),
  * <hi #fff200>each figure should include a dashed horizontal line at the value 0.05</hi>, 
  * the figure should be saved as ''*.tiff'' file format, and use lzw compression,
  * the name of the file you create should be ''barplots_xxxxxxxxx.tiff'', where ''xxxxxxxxx'' is your student's ID,
  * size should be exactly 16.8 cm × 8.4 cm,
  * resolution should be 600 dpi
The figure doesn't have to look exactly like mine, just try to get close.

**Reproducible and portable script** (details [[recol:reproducible_script|here]]) is the one which I can <fc #ff0000>directly run in R and it will draw the output</fc>. It means that the script has to either include also the original data that should be drawn, or it should read data from the file stored online (i.e. I don't need to open the original Excel file and copy any data). The file should produce always the same figure file named ''barplots_xxxxxxxxx.tiff''. In this case, consider using either 1) ''dput'' function to include the original data in the script (see [[recol:reproducible_script#data_import|here]]), or 2) read data directly from the Excel file __located on the Internet__, using the ''library (readxl)'' (see [[recol:data_import#import_directly_from_excel_xls_or_xlsx_file|here]] how to do it), or 3) some other way how to read data from an online source (e.g. store data on Gist or pastebin.com - see details [[recol:reproducible_script#data_import|here]]).
