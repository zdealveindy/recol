====== Fix my mistakes - sequentially.shortened.sequence function: Solution ======
//David Zeleny//

<code>
# define the function:
sequentially.shortened.sentence <- function (sentence = 'No need to have R depression today, things go
 perfectly smoothly!')
{
  for (i in nchar (sentence):1)
    print (substr (sentence, start = 1, stop = i))
}

# Run the function with default values:
sequentially.shortened.sentence ()

# Run the function with another sentence:
sequentially.shortened.sentence (sentence = 'Here we go! Go - where?')
</code>

===== Additional notes to the solution: =====

  * I could have also enclosed the expression ''print'' in the curly brackets (see code below), but since the ''print'' expression is only a single line of code, this is not necessary:
<code> 
sequentially.shortened.sentence <- function (sentence = 'No need to have R depression today,
 things go perfectly smoothly!')
{
  for (i in nchar (sentence):1)
    {
    print (substr (sentence, start = 1, stop = i))
    }
}
</code>
  * As mentioned in the assignment, I wanted you to only fix my mistakes and mistypes, but not to rewrite the code; if you did, you probably got some minus points.
