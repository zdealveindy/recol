====== Looking at the ecological dataset - Solution ======

Your code may look similar to the following:
<code rsplus>
# REcol Homework 1, Author: David Zeleny, Student ID: p12345678
load (url ('https://github.com/zdealveindy/anadat-r/raw/master/data/vltava.RData'))
max (vltava$env$pH) # maximum measured soil pH is 6.76
sum (vltava$spe[33,]) # sum of species cover is 173
mean (vltava$env$SOILDPT)  # mean soil depth is 23.71478 cm
sum (is.na (vltava$eiv$react)) # 104 species
sum (vltava$spe[64,]>0) # 44 species
</code>

Note the following:
  * do not include pieces of code which are not necessary for the result (e.g. ''names (vltava)'', or ''str (vltava)'');
  * you can apply the function directly on the subsetted object, no need to create intermediate objects (i.e. you can do ''max (vltava$env$pH)'', you don't need to do ''q1 <- vltava$env$pH; max (q1)'');
  * note that single square brackets and double square brackets have different meanings, and don't confuse them (generally, double square brackets, ''[['', are mostly used in ''list'' to subset its components)
