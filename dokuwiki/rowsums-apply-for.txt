====== rowSums × apply × for ======
This exercise is focused on comparison of three approaches which are looping through the dataset. 

**Aim:** count number of species in each sample (row) of the dataset ''dune'' from library ''vegan''.

**What to do:**
  - Initiate library ''vegan'' (you need to install it first if you haven't done it before).
  - Initiate dataset ''dune'', containing data about species composition of vegetation plots sampled in dune vegetation (rows = samples, columns = species).
  - I used function ''rowSums'' to count numbers of species in each plot and saved it into the object ''result.rowSums'': <code rsplus>result.rowSums <- rowSums (dune > 0)
result.rowSums
# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
# 5 10 10 13 14 11 13 12 13 12  9  9 10  7  8  8  7  9  9  8 
</code>
  - Use two other alternative approaches to count numbers of species in each row of the matrix:
      -	using function ''apply'', and save the results into object ''result.apply'',
      - using looping function ''for'', and save the results into an object ''result.for''. 
  - Both ''result.apply'' and ''result.for'' should contain the same result as ''result.rowSums'', and when printed on the screen, all three must give exactly the same result:<code rsplus>result.rowSums
# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
# 5 10 10 13 14 11 13 12 13 12  9  9 10  7  8  8  7  9  9  8 

result.apply
# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
# 5 10 10 13 14 11 13 12 13 12  9  9 10  7  8  8  7  9  9  8 

result.for
# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
# 5 10 10 13 14 11 13 12 13 12  9  9 10  7  8  8  7  9  9  8 
</code>

  - to just initiate the already installed library, you will need the command ''library''. If you have not installed ''vegan'' before, you need to first call ''install.packages''.
  - use function ''data'' to initiate the dataset ''dune'' available in ''vegan''
  - ...
  - These two approaches quite widely differ in the length of the script:
    - this is simple, just use ''apply'' and specify correct ''MARGIN'' and ''FUN'' arguments;
    - in case of ''for'' loop, you need to first create an empty variable ''result.for'', which is a vector of length equal to the number of rows in ''dune'' dataset, and with names of individual items identical with ''rownames (dune)''. Then create a ''for'' loop which will fill the vector element-by-element by the result of the calculation. Functions you may need: ''vector'', ''names'', ''for''.
