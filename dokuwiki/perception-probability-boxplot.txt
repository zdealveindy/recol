====== Perception of probability: draw the boxplot ======

Sherman Kent, an important CIA officer, wrote in his report about “//the results of an experiment with 23 NATO military officers accustomed to reading intelligence reports//” that “//[t]hey were given a number of sentences such as: “It is highly unlikely that ....”. All the sentences were the same except that the verbal expressions of probability changed. The officers were asked what percentage probability they would attribute to each statement if they read it in an intelligence report.//” It turned out that among experienced intelligence officers, there were large differences in percentage probabilities assigned to individual terms.

Similar dataset recently showed up on the Internet, and it may be interesting to visualize it. It was collected among respondents on www.reddit.com, who should assign probabilities between 0 and 100% for phrases like “//chances are slight//” to “//almost certainly//”. 

**What to do:** create fully reproducible R code, which will download the dataset directly from the GitHub repository, and draw the boxplot visualizing the relationship between the term and assigned probabilities. The resulting figure should resemble the one below as closely as possible. The R code can just plot the figure on the screen, or save it into a file (e.g. as a JPG).

  * check the data to see what the separator of individual values is, and choose the relevant function to read them directly from this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/perceptions/master/probly.csv ([[https://www.davidzeleny.net/wiki/doku.php/recol:data_import#using_csv_comma_separated_values_format|this]] may help you)
  * you need to make sure that the left margin of the figure is wide enough to accommodate the labels - function ''par'' will help you with this, but you need to figure out which argument you need to set (call ''?par'' for help)
  * the ''boxplot'' function usually draws the boxplots vertically, but you need to set them horizontally - check which of the function arguments can do that. Also, note that labels on the y-axis are written perpendicular to the axis, while labels on the x-axis are parallel to the axis.
